# RESOLUTION DESCRIPTION

The ideia of the project its create each part of the API as module that can be converted into cloud functions, looking possibility to scalabe on the horizon.

Added tests on Contract, Jobs and Balances repository and response message.

Added postman collection to help on tests API

I would like to create a frontend using react and tailwind to show some skills, but that could be a good tech talk to present for other employees from Deel.

I use conventional commits to create good [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
